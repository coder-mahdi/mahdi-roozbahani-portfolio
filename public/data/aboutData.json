My passion for adventure led me to travel extensively and experience life in various countries and cities across the heart of Africa. After years of exploring new places and cultures, I decided to permanently move to Canada, and I have been living in Vancouver for over a year now. This new chapter in my life has been an exciting journey, and I continue to embrace my love for adventure."
